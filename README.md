# Spam Classification 

This project explores the classification of spam emails using machine learning techniques. It utilizes the Spambase dataset and employs Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms for classification.

**Objectives:**

- Evaluate the performance of RF and XGBoost using cross-validation.
- Analyze the impact of the number of trees on Random Forest performance.
- Identify the importance of different features for spam detection using Random Forest.

**Dataset:**

The project utilizes the Spambase dataset, which contains features extracted from emails to predict whether an email is spam or not.

**Methodology:**

- Data splitting: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using a 70/30 ratio.
- Model training and evaluation: Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers are trained and evaluated using metrics such as recall and AUC.
- Feature importance analysis: Feature importance is calculated using Random Forest.
